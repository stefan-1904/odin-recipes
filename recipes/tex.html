    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a 12-inch skillet. Season both sides of pork chops with taco seasoning, cumin, smoked paprika, and salt.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Place chops in the hot skillet and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a plate, and keep warm.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>In the same skillet, cook and stir onion and bell pepper, until the vegetables just begin to pick up a little color, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Pour in diced tomatoes and green chilies, with their juices, and stir, being sure to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Add chili powder and black pepper to the chicken broth, and stir in.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add thawed corn kernels, sliced zucchini, and uncooked rice. Stir until vegetables are evenly distributed, and make sure all the rice is submerged in the cooking liquid. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <br>       
        <li>Nestle pork chops into the skillet contents, and add any accumulated juices from the chops. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer about 20 minutes.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Remove cover, and continue to simmer until rice is tender and all the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of pork chops should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Garnish with flat-leaf parsley or cilantro and lime slices. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
